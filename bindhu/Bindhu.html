           	<h1 style="text-align:center">I love Nature</h1>
         	<img src="nature.jpg" alt="sunrise"/>
         
         	<p style="font-size:28">If there were no nature, we wouldn’t be alive. Humankind is dependent on nature. We get oxygen to breathe from plants and trees. 
         	Thus, our respiratory system is regulated by nature. Not only this, nature has some magical healing powers which help patients suffering 
         	from various diseases to recover faster. Every minute spent in the lap of nature gives a refreshing and rejuvenating feeling. It lowers the
          	cortisol, commonly known as the stress hormone. Even placing some nice plants around the work window will lead to lower stress. Nature enhances 
          	our brain’s activity and makes us concentrate better and be more focused. This makes our brains more creative and imaginative. Spending time in 
          	nature will provide a healthier and longer life.</p>
          
          	<h1 style="text-align:center;color:violet">MY Favourite Food </H1>
          	<img src="poori.jpeg" alt="poori"/>
          	<p style="font-size:28">When I was a child, if you asked me whether I wanted chapathi or poori, I will say in a blink “poori”, as it has a great taste, and taste was the 
          	biggest priority at that time. Now I would say “chapathi”. When you are young you don’t care about calories, carbohydrates, cholesterol etc. These are
          	haunting only when you are grown up. As a child, poori was a favorite dish whenever I went to a restaurant mostly I would order poori.</p>
