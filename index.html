			<p>The joining the dots (JTD) Foundation had given life to us. It is The place  to fill  our dream job colorfull . We lost our confidence level when we were in college, because there was no sufficient facilities to get into job and survive. But when we are seeking for the help ,Suddenly one day  JTD  came to our college and have given chance to join into it. And jtd provided the laptops for each and everyone of us. They provided us whatever the facilities we need.

			After completing our studies we completely focussed on coding , however we could not read thoroughly . So our foundation took one step forward and decided to run bootcamp where everyone can come and study in one place. There are nearly 20 members in our batch. Again in that there are sub groups. Our group has 4 members. Named by <a href="pavani/pavani1.html">Pavani</a> ,<a href="shireesha/shireesha.html"> Shireesha</a> ,<a href="bindhu/Bindhu.html">Bindhu</a> ,<a href="sumithra/sumithra.html">Sumithra</a>.
