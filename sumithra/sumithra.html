I lost my confidence level when I was in college, because there was no sufficient facilities to get into job and survive. But when we are seeking for the help ,Suddenly one day  JTD  came to our college and have given chance to join into it. And jtd provided the laptops for each and everyone of us. They provided us whatever the facilities we need.</h3>
